# Avado Interactive Task

## How to run

## Project setup

- SASS: used with VS Code Watch Sass extension. I used this as I am quiet familiar working with Sass and I feel like it speeds up much development. Also like having variables and mixins

- Bootstrap: I am a big fan of Bootstrap because of the components they provide. It speeds the development. It also provides various out of the box styles which can make the intial site look great. Also they provide various utility classes and grids which helps me with responsiveness.

- Fontawesome: I used font awesome icons to give visual clues to users about where they are and also as a secondary indication what they clicked on.

- jQuery: Used to hide and show classes and operate the tabs and the accordian when scaled down to mobile
